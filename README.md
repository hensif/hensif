- 👋 Hi, I’m @hensif
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about software engineering and tech as a whole as I develop my coding ability.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript through The Odin Project. I previously completed the web design course on freeCodeCamp, as well as the majority of the
-     JavaScript algorithms and data structures course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that give me an opportunity to learn and grow as a developer.
